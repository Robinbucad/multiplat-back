# Twitter Clone Back End

This is the backend of the twitter clone, in which the user has to register and authenticate in order to use the application.

To develop the application I am going to use TypeScript, Node, MongoDB, and for testing I am going to use Jest, and supertest.

## Back End build with

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node
- NPM
- Nodemailer
- JWT
- Jest
- Supertest

## Testing

To test the back end, I have created another database to be able to do the tests without damaging the development database.

At the moment I have the login, registration, and authentication test, and this is the coverage:

Often as the application grows and tests are done, I will update this data.
